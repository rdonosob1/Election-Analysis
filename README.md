# Election-Analysis
Using Phyton to assist Tom, an employee at the Colorado board of elections, to automate, audit, and generate a report of a U.S. congressional election process in Colorado.

## Overview of Election Audit
As mentioned above, Tom works for the Colorado board of elections who needs to audit the process, and his manager has suggested him to use the capability of Phyton in order to automate the process. Therefore, If this audit is successfully performed with Phyton, then this code may be useful for auditing not only other congressional districts, but also senatorial and local election processes as well.  

## Election Audit Results
As a result, this project will generate reports as shown below:
  1. Total number of votes cast in this congressional election
  2. Breakdown of county votes - The total number of votes per county and its correspondent percentage of votes as well. 
  3. Largest County Turnout - The county with largest number of votes 
  4. Breakdown of votes that each candidate received - Total number of votes and the correspondent percentage of votes that each candidate received. 
  5. The winner of the election, as well as the winner vote count and the percentage of the total votes received. 

The image below illustrates, that among 3 participants, the winner of the Election is Diana DeGette who received 272,892 votes (73.8% of the total voting count). 

Likewise, among 3 counties (Arapahoe, Denver and Jefferson, the Largest County Turnout is Denver with 82.8% of votes (306,055 votes) of a total of 369,711.

Finally, it is clear that this audit process has been successful, the current script is designed to analyze results from a congressional election with 3 candidates and 3 participant counties. However, this can be modified in the future using the same principle but not only for congressional and local election processes but also for either a senator election or for presidential elections.
